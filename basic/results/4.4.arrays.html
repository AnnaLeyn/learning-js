		/*##### Task definition (1) ###############

** Build your own array **
	- Read the functions about arrays: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp
	- Ask the user 1 number between 10 and 1000
	- If the user introduces something different to a number between that range, keep asking
		until he introduces a valid number (hint: maybe you need a loop?)
	- If the user introduces a valid number, use that number as a limit and using a FOR LOOP
		create an array with all that consecutive numbers
	- when the array is fullfilled, show an alert saying: "check the console"
	- Print this new array in the console

	* hint: Maybe you need to create an emty array and fill inside the loop
	Example Result:
		//The user has introduced the number 25
		// The array should be like this:
			[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9...21,22,23,24,25]*/

		let favNumber = prompt("What's your favourite number");
		let arrayNumbers = []
		if (favNumber > 10 && favNumber < 1000) {
			for (let i = 0; i < favNumber; i++) {

				arrayNumbers.push(favNumber)
				console.log(i)

			} alert("Check the console")

		} else {
			prompt("What's your favourite number")

		}
