		/*##### Task definition (1) ###############
			For this entire task, you cannot use the "<br>" tag :)
			- Ask the user a number between 0 and 50
			- Check if that number is higher than 50
				- If the number is higher than 50, show an alert message saying "this number is to high" and print the word "ERROR" in the
					browser, with the color red, and the font-size should be 24px.
				- If the number is less than 50
					- Print in the browser the iteration, but in reverse, like this example
		
						iteration: 50
						iteration: 49
						iteration: 48
						iteration: 47
						...
						iteration: 0
					- If the number is 25, skip that iteration and print this message in the browser
						"Im in the middle of the iteration" (This text should be blue)*/
		let roomNumber = prompt('What is your room number?')
		if (roomNumber > 50) {
			alert(' We do not have such rooms')
			document.write("<h1 style='color: red; font-size: 40px;'>ERROR </h1>");

		} else {
			for (let i = roomNumber; i > 0; i--) {

				if (i == 25) {
					document.write("<p style='color: blue;'>Im in the middle of the iteration</p>")

				} else {
					document.write("<p>", i, "</p>")

				}

			}
