		/*##### Task definition (2) ###############
	- Create a function wich receives 2 params
		- First param: is a string
		- Second param is a string 
	- This function will use the first param as a text or the haystack
	- The second param is the word (the needle) I want to search and count how many times appears in the haystack

	Example of how to call this function:
	const text = "This is a huge text, well, maybe not, but it works for this turotial"
	const needle = "i"
	const needleCounter = serachWord(text, needle)
	console.log("The needle: ", needle, " appears ", needleCounter, " times in the text")
	//The needle i appears 5 times in the text
	- Using the same function, count how many times appears the empty space " "*/

		/*const sentence = "This is a huge text, well, maybe not, but it works for this tutorial"
		let counter = 1;
		function search(param1, param2){
		for (let i = 0; i < sentence.length; i++) {
			space = sentence[i];		
			if (space == " "){
				counter++;
			}					
		}
	}console.log("the space appears ", search(), " in the text")	*/
	const sentence = "This is a huge text, well, maybe not, but it works for this turotial";
	let counter = 1;
	function searchWord (needle, haystack){
		
		for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++) {
		
			currentLetter = haystack[i];
			if (needle == currentLetter){
				counter++;
			}
		}
	}searchWord("i", sentence);
