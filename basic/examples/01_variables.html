		To declare a VARIABLE, we use the WORDS:
			- var
			- let 
			- const
		Why 3? because each word works different
			- var => To declare GLOBAL VARIABLES, you can overwrite the value
			- let => To declare LOCAL VARIABLES, you can overwrite the value
			- const => To declare LOCAL OR GLOBAL VARIABLES, you CANNOT overwrite the value (because its a constant value)

		THE MODERN JS RECOMMENDS USE LET AND CONST
