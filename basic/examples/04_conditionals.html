			// =================================================
			// * CONDITIONALS
			// =================================================
			Conditionals statemets are just control structures, will show you a couple of examples
			

			//IF STATEMENT 
			The condition should be defined by programmer
			if(condition){
				console.log("Do some stuff here")
			}

			//IF ELSE
			if(condition){
				console.log("Do some stuff here")
			}else{
				console.log("I have not been able to fulfil the above condition, so I have entered this new control structure.")
			}

			//IF ELSE IF
			if (contidion) {
				...
			} else if() {
				console.log("Im doing a extra check before the IF because I have another condition")
			} else {
				console.log("Both previous conditions was wrong, im the last oportunity")
			}

			// =================================================
			// * COMPARISON OPERATORS
			// =================================================
				- == : Equals in value
				- === : Equals in value and type of value
				- != : Not equals in value
				- !== : Not equals in value and type of value
				- > : greater than
				- < : less than
				- >= : greather than or equal to
				- <= : less than or equal to

				* check more examples or comparsions here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp

			// =================================================
			// * LOGIC OPERATORS
			// =================================================
			3 operators
			- &&: AND
				Example:
					if password == "1234" && role == "admin"
						alert("welcome admin")
			- ||: OR
				Example:
					if hasMoney == true OR hasCreditCard == true
						alert("You can pay this product")

			// =================================================
			// * TASKS
			// =================================================
			1. Using the previous functions (alert, prompt, confirm)
				- Ask the user his age
					- check if his age is greater / higher than 18, show a meesage on the browser with this information
			2. Ask the user his role as user, if the user is different than "admin"
				 shows a message on browser, if is admine, show a custom message on console
			3. Ask the user if he wants to leave the page, if he wants, show a message on browser... "byee"
			4. Let's separate the day into 3 time slots
					- 06:00 to 12:00 => Morning
					- 12:00 19:00 => Afternoon
					- 19:00 06:00 => Night
				Ask the user at what time he/she woke up, depending on the time entered by the user, you should show a different message: 
				good morning, good afternoon, good evening.
