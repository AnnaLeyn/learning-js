		// As you know, you can use functions already defined by JS like:
		// - prompt
		// - parseInt
		// - document.write
		// Also you can define your own funtions to do something
		// - addition
		// - substraction
		// - calculator

		// But, you can use other functions from other objects or data types, like arrays
		const colors = ["red", "blue", "yellow"]
		colors.length //Will give u the total of items of this array
		colors.push("black") //allow us to add a new item to the array
		colors.reverse() //flips this array in reverse

		// But we can the STRINGS has functions or METHODS TOO, as arrays
		const userName = "Tatiana "
		userName.length//Will give us the total of characters it has this string
		const upperName = userName.toUpperCase()//Will put this string in  MAYUSC
		const lowerName = userName.toLowerCase()//Will put this string in  MINUSC
		const cleanedString = userName.trim()//Will delete the empty space from the start and end of the string
		const arrayOfStrings = userName.split("a")//Will cut our string into pieces using the letter "a" as a separator
		const index = userName.indexOf("a")//Will give us the first index of the letter a
		//I saved the new word modified in a new variable because all this functions returns a new word should it be saved 
		// or overwrited you know


		//Also we can use the Strings as arrays, because strings just are a couple of characters joined in the same word right?
		const sentence = "I always make such expensive mistakes"
		for (let i = 0; i < sentence.length; i++) {
			console.log("Character: ",  sentence[i], " is in the position: ", i)			
		}


		// In the future you will learn functions of Objects...but step by step
