		Like in real life we have a multiple data types and multiple options.
		Names:
		- string => sentences or characters
		- number => single numbers (12,0,-2) (Only numbers from 0-9)
		- double => decimal numbers
		- boolean => logical values (true or false)
		- null => xD, null value, means nothing
		- undefined => xD what can I say, just undefined value
		- object //high level for now
		*/

		/*
			STRINGS:
				- Why we call strings? because we are chaining multiple characters 
					h => 1 character
					i => 1 character
					"hi"

				- For strings you can use double quotes or single quotes, but always should be the same, like you cannot 
					open a string with double quotes and close with single quote, that's will throw an error
					example: NEVER => "hello, this shit is bad'
									 GOOD => "this is fine"
									 GOOD => 'this is fine too'
				- ALWAYS if you open a quotes for string, you ALWAYS should close that quote
					example: let name = "John //This will throw an error because the string is open
									 let age = 14

		Using the typeof word
		Example:
			typeof yourVariable

		== TASK ==
		1- shows on the console the type of variables I have previously defined with this format
			"The variable color is: "
			"The variable age is: "
		2- Create a description with your data using variables and show by console with this format
			"***** - ***** - *****"
			"- Name: Elizaveta"
			"- NÂº pets: 2"
			"- Favourite color: red"
			"- Occupation: Developer"
			"- Kids: true"
