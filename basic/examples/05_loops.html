			List of classic loops, all of this loops allows us to iterate or check values
			of big structures one by one
			- while loop
			- do while loop
			- for loop

			EXAMPLES:
				//while loop
				while(condition){
					console.log("do fancy things")
					//in some point, the condition should change inside this loop to 
					//break the condition and go out the loop
				}

				//do while
				do{
					console.log("doing some dark things")
					//In this case this loop is pretty similiar like while, but in this case
					//we are doing something at least 1 time.
					//In while loop we are checking the condition first, instead of do nothing

				} while(condition)

				//for loop
				//This is one of the classics and most used
				//Basically we are starting on the left (let i = 0)
					- we initialize a variable: let i = 0 => "The value of i STARTS at 0"
					- we check that variable: i<10 => "Is i lowest than 10?"
					- we increment the value of i adding 1: i++ => "To the current value of i, I will add 1 more, now is 2"
					- And we repeat these actions until i is greater than 10
				for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
					console.log("iteration: ", 1)
				}

			** IMPORTANT: ALL OF THIS  LOOPS NEEDS A CONDITION TO STOP, OTHERWISE YOU WILL HAVE A 
			INFINITE LOOP, AND YOU DON'T WANT INIFITE LOOPS IN YOUR PC OR IN THE CLIENTS PC

			example:
			//infinte loop
			while(true){
				console.log("im doing a function")
				console.log("im doing a function")
				...
			}

		// =================================================
		// * TASKS
		// =================================================
		// 1.Using the for loop
		// 	- ask the user his name 3 times
		// 		* if the name is "admin" => show a message ...welcome admin
		// 		* if the user introduces a bad name 3 times => show a message...you are not allowed
		
		
		// 2.Using the do while loop
		// 	- ask the user 1 number
		// 		* if the number is greater than 10 => stops the script and show a message...too high
		// 		* if the number is lower than 10 => keep asking numbers and show the previuous number using the alert function
		
		// 3.Using the while loop
		// 	- ask the user one word
		// 		* if the word is different than "exit", keep asking for a word
		// 		* if the word is "exit" => show a message..."byeee"
